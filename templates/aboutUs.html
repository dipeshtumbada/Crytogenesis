    <h2>About Blockchain</h2>
    <p>
      Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it
      difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system.
      A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is
      duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems
      on the blockchain. Each block in the chain contains a number of
      transactions, and every time a new transaction occurs on the blockchain, a
      record of that transaction is added to every participantâ€™s ledger. The
      decentralised database managed by multiple participants is known as
      Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).
    </p>
    <p>
      Blockchain is a type of DLT in which transactions are recorded with an
      immutable cryptographic signature called a hash.
    </p>
    <p>
      This means if one block in one chain was changed, it would be immediately
      apparent it had been tampered with. If hackers wanted to corrupt a
      blockchain system, they would have to change every block in the chain,
      across all of the distributed versions of the chain.
